# myEmail
A light and simple email application with a user friendly GUI.

This application is a relatively small and completely doable project that would give me more experience with AJAX, alongside exploring other new frameworks such as nodemailer. In addition, this would really help me gain a grasp on express.JS, as that is something I really need to touch up on.
